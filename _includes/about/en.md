Hey there! This is Rainyin, also known as Yinhono in English. I'm currently a stressed-out tenth grader in Pudong, Shanghai.

I used to really like classical Chinese literature, so my name comes from the tune title "Yu Lin Ling" (Rain Dripping on Bells) from Liu Yong's poem. I thought three characters looked awkward, so I added "Yin" (sound) at the end, making my full name "Yu Lin Ling Yin," shortened to Lingyin. Of course, after suffering through literature classes, classical Chinese has become my arch-nemesis now (lol).

I'm a Firefly fan, and my friends say I'm not quite mature mentally. I'm definitely not a tech guru (seriously, I'm pretty mediocre), just started a bit earlier than others on this path so I know slightly more.

My interests aren't too complicated (including games, platforms I browse, musicians I like, and maybe other stuff):
Minecraft (survival, building, a little bit of redstone, currently enjoy playing Hypixel Bed Wars - my ID is Rainyinneko, feel free to hit me up), Genshin Impact (quit already), Star Rail, Sky: Children of the Light (log in occasionally), The Three-Body Problem, Coolapk user, Laohu user, Bilibili user, mimi, Chengxing, Pikasonic, Tiaozi, Aimer, Avicii, car enthusiast, aviation enthusiast (mostly model aircraft), slight military enthusiast (mainly just enjoy watching Teacher Hua's videos while eating), phone rooting, Magisk modules, and many other random things.

Nice to meet you all!
