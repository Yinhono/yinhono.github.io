Hi there, I'm Lingyin(铃音), and you can also call me Rainyin or Yinhono. I'm currently a poor, suffering high school student in Pudong, Shanghai.

I used to be really into classical Chinese literature, so I took my name from the Ci poem title "Yu Lin Ling" (Rain Bell) by Liu Yong. I thought a three-character name looked awkward, so I added the character "Yin" (sound) at the end. Of course, after being tortured by liberal arts studies, I now consider classical Chinese my lifelong nemesis (laughs).

I'm a huge fan of Firefly. My friends say I'm a bit immature. I'm not really a tech expert, just someone who started a bit earlier on this path, so I know a little bit more.

My interests are pretty diverse (including games, online platforms, favorite music producers and singers, and maybe more):

Minecraft(survival,building,a little bit of redstone,currently really into Bed Wars - my ID is Rain_Lingyin, feel free to hit me up on Hypixel!), Genshin Impact (retired), Honkai: Star Rail, Sky: Children of the Light (play occasionally), The Three-Body Problem, KuAn, Linuxdo, Bilibili, Mimi, Orangestar, Pikasonic, COP, Aimer, Avicii, Train enthusiast, Aviation enthusiast (more into model airplanes), Slightly into military stuff (mostly just enjoy watching videos from 花老师 as background while I eat)

So... I've talked a lot about myself. Let's all work hard together!
